<!-- 
    This is file 2-of-2 to retrieve all the metadata from a Salesforce Org
    This is required as Salesforce has limit of 10,000 files that can be extracted at 
    one time. file 2-of-2 contains the metadata types that are likely to have a lot of 
    values.

    You may need to adjust the metadata types in file 1-of-2 & file 2-of-2 depending on
    you org to stay within the limit of 10,000 files

    Please refer to file 1-of-2 for more details on how this package.xml file has been
